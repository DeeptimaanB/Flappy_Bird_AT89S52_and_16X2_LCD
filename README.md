# Flappy_Bird_AT89S52_and_16X2_LCD

The codes for the project are in the codes folder
i) game.c is the embedded c program that can be compiled and modified in keil.
ii) game.hex is the built hex file that has to be uploaded to the microcontroller. In my case, I built it with crystal frequency 11.0592 MHz.

The circuit diagram folder contains the circuit of the hardware, it can be modified an per each user's use case and so the code also has to be changed.

The simulation folder contains the hardware and software simulation for the project in mp4 format. Please download it.

Happy to share.
